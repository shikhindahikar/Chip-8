# Chip-8

Chip-8 emulator for PC. I have followed this for understanding the project: https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator/ 

Occassionally used wikipedia and chip-8 manual, where all the specifications of functions and opcodes are written.
It follows the basic principle of every computer architecture, fetch-decode-execute. Used SDL for GUI. Game ROMs can be downloaded from online anywhere.
